## Introduction
M11 collects Used Cooking Oil (UCO) from FBOs in the food industry and households to produce eco-friendly biodiesel. Our robust production units seamlessly run quality checks before the commencement of the manufacturing process so that clean output is received. We endeavor to focus on producing a renewable product out of hazardous waste. The consumption of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) poses adverse health effects; in the wake of the same, FSSAI has fixed a limit for Total Polar Compounds at 25%, beyond which the vegetable oil should not be used. From 1st July 2018 onwards, all Food Business Operators (FBOs) must monitor
the quality of oil whilst frying in compliance with these regulations.
